Source for my personal website
====
This is the source that is used for my personal website. It's built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a static site.

With the exception of the Jekyll core everything is built from scratch. All HTML, CSS and JavaScript is handwritten and no libraries are used.

I'm using Jade as a preprocessor for the HTML and SASS for preprocessing all the CSS. Gulp is used as a task runner to build the site locally for development.

This is being hosted on GitHub and can be viewed at [royledford.github.io](https://royledford.github.io) and also from my own domain at [www.royledford.com](http://www.royledford.com).

I based the setup of this site on the videos from Travis Neilson at [DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJhhLvW-Xvg) and his series of videos. Huge thanks to Travis for showing the way :)
