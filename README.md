Main blogging page for Roy Ledford
=============================

This is the source for my blog that is hosted on Github Pages.

My main site, [www.royledford.com](http://www.royledford.com) will link to this blog page. Eventually I will move my entire site to this.

It is using jekyll, sass, gulp, and jade for html templating.

I based the setup of this site on the videos from DevTips.

I'm a Front End Developer with an extensive background in Managmement and Software Development.
