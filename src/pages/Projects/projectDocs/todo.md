# Todo app challenge

[Todo app challenge](http://www.royledford.com/project-todo-react/)was completed as a challenge to build a functional app in react in 8 hours. although it is a simple todo, an extra feature was added to create a top level project that contains the todos.

There is no data storage in the app as that was beyond the scope of the project. All changes in the app are stored in state while the app is running.


Built using create-react-app and hosted on GitHub pages. The progress gauge uses inline-svg. Designed as a mobile first app to limit time spent on building responsive styling.
