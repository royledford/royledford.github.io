# My Investment Time

My Investment Time provides a simple way to track and find a project to work on,
and get ideas for, your investment or free time. This was built as part of a challenge for a co-working space I frequented.

The app uses React, HTML and CSS. The overall design is inspired by google material and dribbble. All components are built from
scratch using css/javascript/react components,

The project uses a Ruby on Rails API connected to PostgreSQL database for the backend and React for the front end.
