# Sonic Quiver

Sonic Quiver is a production music company providing licensed music world wide. I was the lead designer / developer on the redesign of their existing website. A large part of the redesign was to provide a modern and simplified design that was responsive and provided a mobile as well as desktop experience.

The client also wanted to provide an esthetic that more closely matched the personality of the company. The owner has a very "west coast surfer" vibe and wished to portray that as part of the redesign.

Also, much of her client base now accesses the web via mobile devices and this was an import part of the process in the redesign.
