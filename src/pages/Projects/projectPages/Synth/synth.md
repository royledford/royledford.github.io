# Keyboard Synth

A web synthesizer. The UI is inspired by the Teenage Engineering OP-1.

Iâ€™ve always been intrigued by electronic music device UIs. Due to the constraints of the physical form factor you need to use unique ways of reusing elements to fit all the required functionality.

I was also interested in understanding how the Web Audio API works.

**Tech** = React, Typescript, Tailwind, Shadcn/ui
