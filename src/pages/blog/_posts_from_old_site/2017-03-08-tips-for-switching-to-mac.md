Are you a windows user and have switched to a Mac. I've done the same and have some tips to make the process a little easier.


## Application Menu Bar

Windows applications typically have a menu bar at the top of the application window. On a Mac that menu bar is at the top of the screen. When an application has focus, the menu bar will switch to display options for that application.

Since I've been on a Mac I prefer it on the top of the screen. It's always in the same place and you don't have to hunt for the window that contains it.

The Apple icon on the left gives quick access to the system preferences and information about your system.

When an app is full screen, moving the cursor to the top of the screen will cause the menu to display.

## Min, Max, Close
Similar to windows, applications have a Minimize, Maximize and Close icon for the application's windows. It's located on the top left corner of the applications window.

The Close button works differently from Windows however. It will close the _window_ but not quit the application. To _quit_ the application, choose Quit from application menu.

## Dock (Windows Taskbar)

Windows has the Taskbar, [Mac has the Dock](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201730). Although similar, there are some differences in how they work. The dock allows you to keep applications and documents available for quick access.

You may be wondering what the small dot under an icon in the dock means. When an application is closed, the window is closed, but the app continues to run. The black dot denotes that the app is still running.

## Finder (Windows Explorer)

Mac has the _Finder_ app which is similar to Windows Explorer.

[Apple has a great article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201748) on switching from Explorer to Finder. Definately worth a read.

Here are a few tips for making the Finder feel more explorer like.

- Sort folders first: See this [www.howtogeek.com](https://www.howtogeek.com/67100/force-your-mac-to-put-folders-on-top-of-files-windows-style/) article for info on changing the display.
- Show Path and Status Bars: With the Finder open, select the _View_ menu. Select the _Show Status Bar_ and _Show Path Bar_ items to display in the _Finder_ window.

## Force quit Application

Need to close that pesky application that is stuck? Pressing `command + option + escape` will open the _force quit_ window allowing you close the application.

## Spotlight Search

Windows has the _Search_ option in the start menu. The Mac equivalent is _Spotlight Search_. Press `command + spacebar` to start the search. It will search for applications, files, folders and the internet for answers.

## Activity Monitor

The Mac _Activity Monitor_ is similar to Windows _Task Manager_. Spotlight Search for _Activity Monitor_ to start.
