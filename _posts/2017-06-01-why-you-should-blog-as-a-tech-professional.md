I've recently started blogging, in fact this is my first real blog post. I have written some posts previously for companies that I have worked at, but those were specific to that company. I've never done it for my own personal benefit however.

This isn't to say that Io have never written publicly regarding my personal career. I was a frequent contributor to many online newsgroups and discussion groups in the past.

I wanted to talk a little about why I feel it is important that I start and why you should too.

When I first started developing software I joined a local user group and quickly became involved with the founders of the group. I was interested in learning more about software and how it was being used.

One of the items



You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
