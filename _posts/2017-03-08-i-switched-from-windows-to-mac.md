I started my computing career on Windows and have been using it as a platform
for longer than I can remember. I've been working as a software developer
with a focus on AutoCAD and AutoPlant development and every company I've
worked for was standardized on Windows, both desktops and servers.

Recently I decided to make a change in my career and focus more on Web
Development. To make that a reality I purchased a new MacBook Pro 15". I talked
to a few Mac people prior and was told "It will take a lot to get used to,
but you will love it eventually."

Trasnitioning to the Mac was much easier than I thought.
