      p #[a(href='http://sonicquiver.royledford.com') Sonic Quiver] is a production music company providing licensed music world wide. I was the lead designer / developer on the redesign of their existing website. A large part of the redesign was to provide a modern and simplified design that was responsive and provided a mobile as well as desktop experience.
      p The client also wanted to provide an esthetic that more closely matched the personality of the company. The owner has a very "west coast surfer" vibe and wished to portray that as part of the redesign.
      p Also, much of her client now accesses the web via mobile devices and this was an import part of the process in the redesign.
