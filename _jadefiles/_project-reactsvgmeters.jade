        #[a(href='http://www.royledford.com/react-svg-meters/') React SVG Meters] is an npm package that
        allows you to easily display percentage based meters in a react based single page web application.

        I developed the concept and built the package including the auto-generated document for the components.
        The documentation site uses react-docgen to mine comments from the source code and build pages
        for each component. It also allows the use of example pages and display syntax highlighted code
        for the component to show how to use them in your own app.

        React was used for both development of the components and the documentation site. The components
        use in-line svg for display and are controlled by props to customize their appearance.
