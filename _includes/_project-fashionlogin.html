micro-animations to a login / sign up form. The overall goal was to both improve the user experience
and to help inform them of incorrect entries in the form controls.</p><p>Special attention was paid to the informational messages displayed on validation of the form controls.
A slight shake was added to the input and a color coordinated message displayed to help the user understand
the entered information required their attention.</p><p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/royledford/fashion-login-form">github</a></p></div><div class="copy copy-section-1"><h3>Technology.</h3><p>The study is built using react and react-router. A custom HOC was used to manage transitions between routed pages.
The HOC uses ReactCssTransitions to control enter and leave animations.</p></div><img src="/assets/img/work-fashionlogin/signup-email.jpg" alt="Fashion Login screenshot" class="img-1"/><video src="/assets/img/work-fashionlogin/email.mp4" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" class="img-2"></video><video src="/assets/img/work-fashionlogin/password.mp4" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" class="img-3"></video></article></section>
