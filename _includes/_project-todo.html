build a functional app in react in 8 hours. Although it is a simple todo, an extra feature was added to
create a top level project that contains the todos.</p><p>There is no data storage in the app as that was beyond the scope of the project. All changes in the app
are stored in state while the app is running.</p><p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/royledford/project-todo-react">github</a></p></div><div class="copy copy-section-1"><h3>Technology.</h3><p>Built using create-react-app and hosted on GitHub pages. The progress gauge uses inline-svg.
Design as a mobile first app to limit time spent on building responsive styling.</p></div><img src="/assets/img/work-todo/todo-home.jpg" alt="Todo home screenshot" class="img-1"/><img src="/assets/img/work-todo/todo-task.jpg" alt="Todo task screenshot" class="img-2"/><img src="/assets/img/work-todo/todo-meter.jpg" alt="Todo meter screenshot" class="img-3"/></article></section>
