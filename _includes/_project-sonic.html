I was the lead designer / developer on the redesign of their existing website. A large part of the redesign was to provide a modern and simplified design that was responsive and provided a mobile as well as desktop experience.</p><p>The client also wanted to provide an esthetic that more closely matched the personality of the company. The owner has a very "west coast surfer" vibe and wished to portray that as part of the redesign.</p><p>Also, much of her client now accesses the web via mobile devices and this was an import part of the process in the redesign.</p></div><div class="copy copy-section-1"><h3>Technology.</h3><p>Full site was built using React. Recents page uses Youtube API to show latest videos in Sonic Quiver's channel.</p></div><img src="/assets/img/work-sonic/home.jpg" alt="Sonic Quiver home page" class="img-1"/><img src="/assets/img/work-sonic/recents.jpg" alt="Sonic Quiver recent work page" class="img-2"/><img src="/assets/img/work-sonic/agents.jpg" alt="Sonic Quiver picture of agents list page" class="img-3"/><img src="/assets/img/work-sonic/about.jpg" alt="Pic of info about Sonic Quiver" class="img-4"/></article></section>
