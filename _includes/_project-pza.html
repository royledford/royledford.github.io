<section id="pza"><article><h1>PZA Parlour</h1><h2>Creative Director / Product Design</h2><p>PZA is an Italian restaurant in Calgary AB with a style and atmosphere designed to reflect the owner growing up in a family of local restaurateurs. Being an avid motorcyclist, he wished to display his personal bike as part of the decor. I was involved to provide an overall design of the customizations to the motorcycle as well as provide a display piece for the pizza delivery and take out area.  </p></article></section>
