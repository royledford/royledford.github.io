Being an avid motorcyclist, he wished to display his personal bike as part of the decor. I was involved to provide an overall design of the customizations to the motorcycle as well as provide a display piece for the pizza delivery and take out area.  </p></div><div class="copy scooter-copy"><h3>Vintage 1960 Puch Cheetah scooter.</h3><p>Sourced vintage scooter for restoration to be a showpiece for the pizza take-out area.

I wanted to provide a vintage inspired design to match the esthetic of the interior and invoke the rich Italian heritage of his family and the motorcycle. The overall design is based on historic race bikes of the 1970s.</p><p>The color, which seems out of character for a Ducati, was chosen to invoke early Ducati’s and match the design of the restaurant.</p><p>The overall design is meant to evoke the feeling of a motorcycle sponsored by PZA. The sponsor stickers, seen frequently on race bikes, where chosen to align with the restaurant brand. Many subtle references to the owner’s history, Italian racing history, and the food industry have been included.</p></div><img src="/assets/img/work-pza/ducati1.jpg" alt="1990 Ducati Supersport with custom blue paint and tins." class="img-ducati1"/><img src="/assets/img/work-pza/ducati2.jpg" alt="1990 Ducati Supersport with custom blue paint and tins." class="img-ducati2"/><img src="/assets/img/work-pza/ducati3.jpg" alt="1990 Ducati Supersport with custom blue paint and tins." class="img-ducati3"/></article></section>
