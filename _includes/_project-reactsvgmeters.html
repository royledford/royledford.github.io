allows you to easily display percentage based meters in a react based single page web application.</p><p>I developed the concept and built the package including the auto-generated document for the components.
The documentation site uses react-docgen to mine comments from the source code and build pages
for each component. It also allows the use of example pages and display syntax highlighted code
for the component to show how to use them in your own app.</p></div><div class="copy copy-section-1"><h3>Technology.</h3><p>React was used for both development of the components and the documentation site. The components
use in-line svg for display and are controlled by props to customize their appearance.</p></div><img src="/assets/img/work-reactsvgmeters/demo.jpg" alt="react svg meters demo page" class="img-1"/><img src="/assets/img/work-reactsvgmeters/docpage.jpg" alt="react svg meters documentation example" class="img-3"/><img src="/assets/img/work-reactsvgmeters/mobile-nav.jpg" alt="react svg meters mobile nav example" class="img-2"/></article></section>
